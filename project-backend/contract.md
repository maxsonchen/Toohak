1. When and where will we schedule meetings (e.g. 11am Wednesdays and 2pm Fridays: in-person at X location, or on Teams video call)?
    In person during labs & Teams video call on Saturday afternoon (2pm)

2. How will meeting hosts be planned so that team members share the leading of meetings equally?
    Rotating order of hosting [Daniel -> Sophia -> Riddick -> Maxson -> Naman]. Host is responsible for the gitlab Wiki post.

3. Where will we record our meeting minutes (Gitlab Wiki or Gitlab markdown file)?
    Miutes recorded in GitLab Wiki.

4. How many days before the iteration due date do we expect individual tasks to be completed by (i.e. when is our internal deadline(s))? 
    3 days before the task is due.

5. What is the expected response time for messages/posts on MS Teams when communicating with each other?
    Within 12 hours.

6. What is the expected turn-around time for reviewing merge requests? What is our approach to conducting code reviews?
    Notify Teams Chat then within 12 hours.

7. How will we handle conflicts (i.e. differing opinions)? Note: If conflicts cannot resolved this way, please contact your tutor.
    Discuss in meetings or over teams. If still can't reach a decision then by anonymous vote. 

8. List the steps a team member does if they get stuck (e.g. stuck debugging).
    Notify a team member and organise a call.

9. A day before the due date we notice a team member's work is very broken and incomplete. Instead of waiting until the due date, list the steps we will take to prevent this from occuring in the first place. Note: contact your tutor if this happens as well. 
    Complete check-ins in meetings to ensure progress and provide help with debugging.
    Daily Stand ups.
